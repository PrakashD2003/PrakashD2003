## 👨‍💻 About Me

- 🎓 Third-year B.Tech student in Computer Science and Engineering (AI/ML), focused on building **end-to-end ML pipelines**, mastering **MLOps automation**, and **cloud-native deployment**.
- 🌐 Hands-on with **AWS** (EC2, S3, EKS, SageMaker, CloudWatch), **Terraform**, **Kubernetes**, **Docker**, and **MLflow**.
- 🧪 Recently completed an intensive 6-month MLOps 'bootcamp' @ **Edera**, which culminated in my successful technical evaluation for a client-facing role.
- ✅ My GitHub is the portfolio of this work—I build projects that don't just work in notebooks, but deploy, scale, and are monitored in the cloud.
- 📚 Learning never stops — always experimenting with Databricks, LangChain, and Agentic AI systems!

## 📂 Featured Projects

### 🔧 [Vehicle Insurance Prediction – MLOps Pipeline](https://github.com/PrakashD2003/Vehicle-Insurance-Prediction-Mlops-Project)
An end-to-end MLOps system for predicting vehicle insurance adoption using real-world data.

**Tech Stack:** MongoDB, Scikit-learn, FastAPI, Flask, Docker, Terraform, Ansible, GitHub Actions, AWS (EC2, S3, ECR, IAM, CloudWatch), MLflow, DVC

- Built modular ML pipeline: data ingestion → validation → transformation → model training → deployment  
- Implemented a **champion/challenger logic** in the model evaluation stage, automatically comparing new models against the production model and triggering deployment only if performance improved.  
- Deployed real-time predictions using Dockerized FastAPI on AWS EC2  
- Automated infrastructure provisioning and CI/CD deployment workflows
