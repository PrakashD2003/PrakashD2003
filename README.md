## 📂 Featured Projects

### 🔧 [Vehicle Insurance Prediction – MLOps Pipeline](https://github.com/PrakashD2003/Vehicle-Insurance-Prediction-Mlops-Project)
An end-to-end MLOps system for predicting vehicle insurance adoption using real-world data.

**Tech Stack:** MongoDB, Scikit-learn, FastAPI, Flask, Docker, Terraform, Ansible, GitHub Actions, AWS (EC2, S3, ECR, IAM, CloudWatch), MLflow, DVC

- Built modular ML pipeline: data ingestion → validation → transformation → model training → deployment  
- Implemented a **champion/challenger logic** in the model evaluation stage, automatically comparing new models against the production model and triggering deployment only if performance improved.  
- Deployed real-time predictions using Dockerized FastAPI on AWS EC2  
- Automated infrastructure provisioning and CI/CD deployment workflows
